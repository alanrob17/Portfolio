In one of the Windows 10 feature upgrades Microsoft decided to make Powershell the default command shell on the Windows start menu (``Win-X`` keys). I use Powershell occasionally and wanted the option to use the Command prompt instead.

To do this go to:

```
    Settings  > Personalization > Taskbar
```

![Taskbar settings](../images/taskbar.jpg "Taskbar settings")

There is an option to replace Windows Powershell with the command prompt.
